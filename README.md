## How to install this plugin

- [ ] Put BRAT installation instructions here

*If you see this plugin in the Obsidian community plugins explorer and the BRAT installation instructions are still here, future Matias forgot to update this readme. If you would be so kind, please let him know that the readme is out of date - I'm sure he'll be grateful for the reminder.*
