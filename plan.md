# Doomsidian Plugin Development Plan

## Overview
Doomsidian is an Obsidian plugin that aims to provide a Doom Emacs org-mode-like experience within Obsidian, focusing on visual styling and behavior that matches Doom Emacs' org-mode rendering.

## Key Features

### 1. Header Concealment and Styling
- Conceal leading markdown hashtags (#) while preserving document structure
- Replace the final hashtag with a visually appealing symbol (like Doom's ◉,○,✱,✸)
- Headers should NOT be visually indented, only their content should be
- Apply Doom Emacs-inspired colors to headers
- Maintain uniform header text size

### 2. Content Indentation
- Indent content under headers based on header level
- Indentation per header can be configured by the user, defaulting to the width of the header hashtags (in other words, it would be as if the number of hashtags in the header was inserted directly ahead of every line of content under the header)
- Lists, blockquotes, and code blocks should maintain proper indentation within their header context
- Indentation must persist correctly during scrolling

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Plugin Setup
1. Initialize plugin structure
   - Set up basic plugin architecture
   - Implement settings management
   - Create configuration panel for customization

2. Establish CodeMirror Integration
   - Create ViewPlugin for editor integration
   - Set up StateField for tracking document structure
   - Implement basic decoration system

### Phase 2: Header Processing
1. Header Detection and Tracking
   - Parse markdown headers
   - Build header hierarchy tree
   - Track parent-child relationships

2. Header Styling
   - Implement header marker concealment
   - Add custom header symbols
   - Apply Doom-inspired color scheme
   - Ensure headers remain unindented

### Phase 3: Content Indentation
1. Content Analysis
   - Track content blocks under headers
   - Identify special elements (lists, quotes, code blocks)
   - Calculate appropriate indentation levels

2. Visual Rendering
   - Apply indentation through CodeMirror decorations
   - Handle nested content properly
   - Maintain scroll position context

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Header parsing
   - Indentation calculation

2. Integration Tests
   - Editor interaction
   - Scrolling behavior
   - Large document performance

3. Visual Tests
   - Style consistency
   - Indentation accuracy
   - Header symbol rendering

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize parsing operations
- Cache document structure where possible
- Minimize DOM operations
- Handle large documents efficiently
- Debounce scroll and update events
